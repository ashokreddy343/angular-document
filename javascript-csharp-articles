Javascript
	1.JavaScript is a language of the Web.
Prototypal inheritance – Inherited property 
	1.Objects inherit from Objects
	2. we know an object is a prototype of classes
How do we implement prototypical inheritance ?
	Use property called _proto_
	ex:var automobile={engine:true}
	   var car={tyres:4}
	car._proto_=automobile;//inheritance
Is __proto__ only way to prototypal inheritance?  
	No, you could you Object to create it
	var automobile={engine:true};
	var car=Object.create(automobile);
Is there any other way to check property in object?
	Yes,you could use below pattern to validate,
	"engine" in car;//true
	"valueOf" in {};//true
Javascript Data types
How many data types are there in JS?
	there are two types of data types in Javascript
	1.Primitive data type
		a)string b)Number c)Boolean d)Undefined e)Null
	2.Non-primitive(reference)data type
		a)object b)Array c)RegExp
How do you specify data type in JS? 
	It’s simple and could be defined using var keyword only 
	var x=10;
	var x="javascript"
To calculate size of javascript we can use sizeof.js we can use
	ex:var object={'boolean':true,'number':1,'string':'a','array':[1,2,3]};
	    var size=sizeof(object);
What is the difference in Undefined and Null? 
	 1.In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, such 
		ex:var TestVar;
	  	alert(TestVar); //shows udefined
	  	alert(typeof TestVar); //shows undefined
	  2.null is an assignment value.it can be assigned to a varible as
	    no value
	   	var TestVar=null;
		alert(TestVar);//shows null
		alert(typefo TestVar); //shows object
Objects
	Objects are varibles too.However,objects can contain many values
	var person={age:50;address:"delhi"}

Do you know simple way to create objects? 
	var obj={}; //undefined
	typeof(obj);//object
	To Access object propeties in two ways
		1.objectName.propertyName
		2.objectName["propertyName"]
		ex:person.age or Person["age"]
Object Methods
	you access an object method with the following sytax
	 	objectName.methodName();
	ex:var person = {age:59, address:"Delhi", fullName:function(){console.log('Joh n Doe');return 'John Doe';}}; 
		 person.fullName(); 
Loop over all properties in Object 
	 for(a in person){console.log(a)} 

How do you add/delete properties to existing object? 
	person.country="india"
	delete person.age; 
Can you access a property, which do not exist in Object? 		
	Yes, you can access a property on an object that does not exist but will result in undefined
	person.lastName;//undefined

Can you access a method, which do not exist in Object? 
	No, you cannot access a method on an object that does not exist because it’ll yield an error
	person.lastName();//Uncaught TypeError:person.lastName is not a function

Javascript Engines
What is the difference between interpreted v/s compiled languages? 
	compiled
		1.: In compiled language, a compiler will translate the program directly into code that is specific to the target machine, which we call machine code
		2.Then the computer will run the machine code on its own. 
 	Interpreted:
		1.In an interpreted language the code is not directly run by the machine
		2.there is another program which reads and then executes the code
		3.This other program is known as the interpreter. 

Is JavaScript an interpreted language or compiled language? 
	Historically it was designed as interpreted language. 

Which category of language JavaScript belongs?	
	JavaScript is considered as a high-level language. It’s readable by humans easily. 

What is a JavaScript engine? 
	1. It’s a program or library, which executes JavaScript code. 
Evolution of javascript engines
	1.mozila : SpiderMonkey
	2.Chrome :V8
	3.IE & Edge : Chakra
	4.Node.js :v8
	5.PhantomJs(headless browser) : Javascript core

Which JavaScript engine scores high? 	
	1. You can compare how various engines perform in benchmarking produced on 
		http://arewefastyet.com
How Javascript engine works?
	Hers is the process
	SourceCode->Parser->AST->ByteCode Generator->Bytecode->Interpreter->Machine code
	The parser takes JavaScript and generates a Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). 
	AST: It’s just a syntax tree, and a tree representation of source code
	After AST is generated, there are two choices depending upon JavaScript engine to generate bytecode 
	 Google V8 & Chakra generates Native code and both are really fast engines to run JavaScript

Common Mistakes
	1.Mistake 1: Equality checks 
	   use 1===='1'
	2.Mistake 2: Concatenation 
		JavaScript uses + operator for concatenation & addition
Is JavaScript an object oriented language? 
	 1.Yes it is, but many developers differ because there is no “class” keyword in it.
	 2.I believe JavaScript has all the ingredients to be an OOP language

Encapsulation
	1.Encapsulate means “enclose (something) in or as if in a capsule”. 
	2. It refers enclosing all the functionalities within that object, so it is hidden from rest of the application.
