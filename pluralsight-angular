Introduction to Components
	What is a component ?
		Component=Template+Class(properties,methods)+metadata
			Template=view layout,Created with HTML,Includes binding and directives
			Class=Code supporting the view,Created with Typescript,Properties:data,Methods:logic
			MetaData
				1.Extra data for angular
				2.Defined with a decorator
				3.Decorator is a function
		Creating the component class
			export class AppComponent{
			  pageTitle:string='Acme Product Management"
			}
		Defining the Metadata
			@Componet({
				selector:'',
				template:''
				})
			Decorator
				A function that adds metadata to a class,its members,or its method arguments
				Prefixed with an @
				Angular provides built-in decorators
				@Component()
		Importing What we need
			1.Before we use an external function or class,we define
			  where to find it
			2.Angular is Modular
				@angular/core,@angular/animate,@angular/http,@angular/router
	Bootstraping Our App Component
	1.What is the minimum definition of a component?
		The absolute minimal configuration for a @Component in angular is a template.
	2.What is the difference between a component and a directive?
		component
			1.@Component meta-data annotation is used to register the components
			2.The components are used to create UI widgets
			3.The components are used to split to application into
			   smaller parts
			4.Only one component is used per DOM element
			5.In the components,@View,template and templateUrl 
			  are mandatory in the components
		Directive
			1.@Directive meta-data annotation is used  to register the directives.
			2.The directives are used to add behavior to existing DOM elements.
			3.The directives are use to design a reusable components.
			4.More than one directive are used per DOM element
			5.The directive do not have @View etc.
