Route Guards
	1.Guarding routes means whether we can visit the route or not. 
	2.To achieve route guards, Angular provides following interfaces that are 
	  contained in @angular/router package. 
	CanActivate

		2.It is used to redirect to login page to require authentication.
		3.CanActivate interface has a method named as canActivate() 
		4.  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): 
		     Observable<boolean>|Promise<boolean>|boolean
		5.
	CanActivateChild
		1.CanActivateChild decides whether we can navigate to child routes or not.
		2.It is used to decide link access on the basis of authorization
	CanDeactivate

	Tips,Tricks & Gotchas
		TypeScript & Decorators
			-@Decorator(parameters..)
		Custom Pipes	
			-Pure vs impure
				Pure:Only evaluated when input changes
				Impure:evaluated on every change detection cycle
			Pure are simple,impure are very complex
		Module API
			imports
			exports
			bootstrap
			providers
			declartions
		Cryptic Error Messages
			Frequent
			Frustrating
			Slow down development
		build
		RxJS
			Promises vs observable
			self-subscribe or not
			Forgetting to subscribe
			Accidentally making multiple http requests
			Hot vs cold observables
			shared observables
