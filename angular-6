npm i -g @angular/cli@latest
ng new Angular6Project --skip-tests
Prior to Angular 6, the Angular CLI configuration file is called angular-cli.json
In Angular 6, it is renamed to just angular.json. It's not a simple rename, the file format is also slightly different
The src folder contains the angular application components, templates, services, styles, images, and anything else the application needs.
The files outside of this folder are meant to support building, testing, maintaining, documenting, and deploying the angular application. 
To confirm this Angular application is using Angular Version 6, open package.json file and notice all the Angular packages version is 6.1.0. 
npm i bootstrap@3 jquery --save
ng s --port 1237 -o
ng g c employee/create-employee --spec=false --flat=true

 When you create a new Angular 6 project, this is included automatically by the Angular CLI.
